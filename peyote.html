    <p class="px-6"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> <em>Disclaimer: Peyote is an endangered species and care should be taken to avoid purchasing specimens 
        that have been illegally poached from the wild. Mescaline, the primary psychoactive alkaloid, is also an illegal substance in many 
        countries, and we do not encourage or condone the use of this it where it is against the law. However, we accept that illegal drug 
        use occurs, and believe that offering responsible harm reduction information is imperative to keeping people safe. For that reason, 
        this guide is designed to ensure the safety of those who decide to use peyote responsibly.</em></p>

    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">OVERVIEW</p>
              
    <p class="px-6">Peyote, or <em>Lophophora williamsii</em>, is a species of spineless cactus that contains the psychedelic chemical mescaline. 
        It has a distinctively small, green, and globular appearance, growing close to the ground without any spines. These “crowns” or “buttons” 
        are traditionally cut from the root of the peyote plant and dried for ceremonial use.</p>
            
    <p class="px-6">Native to Mexico and the Southwestern US, peyote has long been a focus of Native American and pre-Colombian ceremonial traditions. 
        Its name derives from the Nahuatl (Aztec) term peyotl and it remains legal for ceremonial use in the US under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. 
        Today, it’s also used in other contexts elsewhere, including in meditation and psychotherapy. It also holds the reputation of being the first psychedelic 
        to come to mainstream Western attention—for better or worse. Due to overharvesting and peyote’s slow-growing nature, the cactus is now an endangered species.</p>
            
    <blockquote>In ceremonial use, peyote is typically either chewed to release the active alkaloids or brewed as a tea. 
        The peyote trip is characterized by visual effects (such as enhanced colors and breathing environments), philosophical 
        and introspective insights, and feelings of euphoria.</blockquote>
              
          
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">EXPERIENCE</p>
            
    <p class="px-6">Many factors contribute to the peyote experience, including dose, mindset, setting, and method of consumption. 
        With that in mind, each individual journey will be unique to the person, time, and place, and there’s no way to predict exactly what 
        will happen. But, peyote does induce some common experiences and effects that can help you prepare for your journey.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold"> What to expect</p>
    <p class="px-6">The effects of peyote are usually felt within 30 minutes to an hour after consumption. For most, the experience begins with 
       increases heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature and some form of physiological discomfort, such as nausea, fullness in the stomach, 
       sweating, and/or chills. These physical symptoms can last up to two hours, before dissolving into a sense of calm and acceptance.</p>
            
    <p class="px-6">At this point, the more subjective, psychological effects take hold, reaching their peak two to four hours after consuming 
        the cactus and gradually declining over the next eight to twelve hours. Peak effects are compared to those of LSD, and are known to profoundly 
        alter one’s perceptions of self and reality, increase suggestibility, and intensify emotions. While some find peyote more sensual and less 
        reality-shifting than LSD, others have trouble telling the difference.</p>
            
    <p class="px-6">Some people experience a deeply mystical or transcendental state, including clear and connected thought, feelings of 
        oneness and unity, self-realization, and ego death, as well as empathy and euphoria. “Bad trips” and dysphoric symptoms tend to be more 
        common among people who ignore the importance of set and setting and/or have a history of mental illness.</p>
            
    <p class="px-6"> Visual effects are also common, including color enhancement, visual distortions (such as “melting” or “breathing” 
        environments), geometric patterns, and the appearance of seemingly autonomous entities.A number of users, including the writer 
        Robert Anton Wilson in his autobiographical book Cosmic Trigger, describe encounters with a little green man, or the “spirit of the plant,” 
        who is often called “Mescalito.”</p>
            
    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">EFFECTS</p>
            
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Pharmacology</p>
        <p class="px-6">Something of a “little green chemical factory,” peyote contains more than 60 different alkaloids, many of which are at least potentially 
        psychoactive to varying degrees, including tyramine, hordenine, pellotine, and anhalonidine. But the primary psychoactive alkaloid is mescaline.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Receptor binding</p>
    <p class="px-6"> Mescaline binds to virtually all serotonin receptors in the brain but has a stronger affinity for the 1A and 2A/B/C receptors. It’s structurally 
        similar to LSD and often used as a benchmark when comparing psychedelics.Like nearly all psychedelics, the effects of mescaline are likely due 
        to its action on serotonin 2A receptors.</p>
        
    <br>

    </div>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Dosage</p>
    <p class="px-6">A light dose of peyote is 50-100g fresh or 10-20g dry, which equates in either case to roughly three to six mid-sized buttons. 
        Moderate doses range up to 150g fresh or 30g dry (six to twelve buttons), while strong doses range up to 200g fresh or 40g dry (eight to sixteen 
        buttons). Anything above this is considered heavy.</p>

    <blockquote>It is hard to be precise, however, due to the varying levels of mescaline in any given peyote button. Growing location and 
        season of harvest can also affect their potency, as can age—older peyote tends to be more potent.</blockquote>

    <BR>
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">BENEFITS & RISKS</p>
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Potential Benefits</p>
    <p class="px-6">In the Native American Church, peyote ceremonies are used to treat a number of psychological, spiritual, and physiological issues. 
        For many, a peyote journey offers deep insight into the self and the universe, giving one a greater sense of connection and spirituality. 
        It’s also known for fostering compassion and gratitude and alleviating psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, PTSD and addiction.</p>

    <p class="px-6">Peyote has also been shown to help people solve problems, access their creativity, be more environmentally conscious, 
        and improve learning. In its original use, the plant medicine was also used to treat a number of ailments, including snake bites, wounds, 
        skin conditions, and general pain. </p>
    
    <br>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Risks</p>
                    
    <p class="px-6">Research into the harm potential and adverse effects of peyote is limited, but in general, it is considered a safe substance. 
       A lethal dose has never been identified, probably because it’s too high to be taken accidentally. In other words, to the best of our 
       knowledge, nobody has ever died from a peyote overdose.</p>

    <p class="px-6">A 2005 study into the ceremonial use of peyote among Native American populations found no detrimental long-term effects. 
        It should be noted, though, that its use in other contexts may not be as safe—later studies have found an association between prior mental 
        health problems and “bad trips.” Still, peyote appears to present little risk of flashbacks, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). </p>
                
    <p class="px-6">Peyote is traditionally consumed by Huichol women during pregnancy, but mescaline has been linked to fetal abnormalities and should be 
        avoided by pregnant or breastfeeding women. </p>
                
     <p class="px-6">  Peyote can increase heart rate and blood pressure, so it should also be avoided by anyone with a heart condition and/or high 
        blood pressure, particularly in combination with blood pressure medications. Other drugs to avoid combining with peyote include tramadol, 
        immunomodulators, alcohol, and stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines. Combining peyote with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) 
        could increase nausea and may even be dangerous. In fact, the nausea that tends to arise from taking peyote alone may have something to do with 
        the presence of naturally occurring MAOIs. 
            </p>

    <BR>
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">PERSONAL GROWTH</p>

    <p class="px-6">Peyote ceremonies have long been held as a way to restore the balance between the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual 
        realms. Outside of its historically sacred context, peyote holds promise for more general personal growth and development.</p>
   
    <p class="px-6">A peyote journey is often characterized by personal blessings, healing, and insights, and many people emerge with an awareness of their place in the web 
        of being. Some people who have taken part in peyote ceremonies have found that the experience allows them to confront their own shadow in order to move 
        past it. Beyond the subjective psychological experience, purging is another important aspect of the peyote ceremony and is thought to be useful for 
        dispensing of deeply rooted fears and other negative emotions.</p>

    <p class="px-6">While formal ceremonies have been developed and refined over many generations, maybe people are now finding the beneficial effects 
        of peyote outside of a religious context. While these people may not believe the ceremonial setting is essential for attaining the profound and 
        life-changing insights or transformations that peyote helps to bring about, indigenous peoples say otherwise. Ethically, it is also best to reserve 
        the use of peyote for these settings. (See Ethical Considerations for more information.)</p>

    <p class="px-6">Solo, meditative peyote experiences can also give rise to insights into the nature of fear, the circle of life, immortality, 
        better living, and so on. Prophetic visions are as common for solo users as those involved in peyote ceremonies, but in all settings, the plant 
        should be approached with respect. As one user put it, “if one does not respect the plant, the plant will certainly teach you to do so.”</p>

    </div>

    <p class="px-6">Peyote ceremonies can last upwards of 10 hours overnight and typically involve drumming, chanting, and prolonged periods of 
         sleeplessness, along with social and behavioral interventions. They often involve prayers and spiritual practices for specific purposes, 
         such as health and well-being, spiritual guidance for important decisions or journeys (such as for soldiers going off to war), or accepting 
         the passing of a loved one. And many users find it helps to set up their intention in a similar way before consuming peyote, for instance by 
         affirming their desire to learn.</p>
            
    <br>       
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">THERAPEUTIC USE</p>

    <p class="px-6">
        In the Native American Church, peyote ceremonies are often used to treat drug and alcohol addiction. And, tellingly, while alcoholism 
        (or at least alcohol abuse) among the Navajo and other Native American tribes is often said to be more than twice the national US average, 
        it tends to be especially low among members of the Native American Church. Whether peyote (or mescaline) therefore represents a 
        promising therapy for alcohol addiction is up for debate, but these findings are supported by anecdotal reports as well as studies into the 
        therapeutic benefits of other psychedelics. Indeed, even William “Bill W” Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, was in favor of psychedelic intervention.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">Peyote’s effect on the serotonin system likely has something to do with the treatment of substance addiction, but the set/setting and social support 
        inherent in the traditional ceremony may have just as much if not more of a therapeutic effect. In addition to the sacrament of peyote, for instance,
        these ceremonies feature a master guide, marathon group sessions, ego reduction techniques, social networks, and a focus on self-actualization throughout.</p>

    <p class="px-6">As a traditional addiction therapy, the peyote ceremony can also provide an addict with visions of his or her eventual ruin, effectively simulating 
        what alcoholics refer to as “rock bottom” and sparking a very real sense of urgency to change. The trance-like state of a ceremony’s continuous drumming and 
        chants can also increase self-awareness, break down denial mechanisms, and give addicts a sense of control. </p>

     <p class="px-6">In addition to its direct effects on the serotonin system, peyote is also associated with a strong “afterglow” effect that can last for up to 
        6 weeks after a ceremony. During this period, users commonly report feeling happier, more empathic, less prone to cravings, and more open to 
        communication—all of which is likely to boost the efficiency of follow-up therapy sessions. Of course, this has obvious implications for the treatment 
        of depression as well, especially given that depression scores are reportedly lower among more active members of the Native American Church.</p>

    <blockquote>Studies suggest that mescaline may increase blood flow and activity in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain in charge 
        of planning, problem-solving, emotional regulation, and behavior. Low activity in this area is linked to depression and anxiety, leading scientists 
        to hypothesize that mescaline could help alleviate symptoms of these disorders.</blockquote>

    <p class="px-6">Mescaline could also help reduce suicidal thoughts, according to researchers at the University of Alabama. Using data from the National 
        Survey on Drug Use and Health, the researchers found that people who have used a psychedelic drug at least once in their life show lower rates of 
        suicidal thinking.</p>

    <p class="px-6">A 2013 study also found that lifetime mescaline or peyote use was significantly linked to a lower rate of agoraphobia, an anxiety 
        disorder where subjects perceive their surrounding environment to be threatening.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">LEGALITY</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Legality of peyote in the United States</p>
    <p class="px-6">In the United States, despite it being a federally controlled Schedule I substance—even in its natural state—peyote is 
        legal for members of the Native American Church under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. And even non-Indians may be permitted 
        to use it as part of “bona fide” ceremonies or serious research.</p>

    <p class="px-6">Peyote can also be consumed with relative freedom—regardless of religious affiliation—in the City of Oakland, CA, which 
        decriminalized all “entheogenic plants” containing indoleamines, tryptamines, or phenethylamines, making it legal for adults aged 21 
        and over to consume peyote and other plant medicines—regardless of ethnicity and religious affiliation. It also specifically decriminalizes 
        (or rather deprioritizes for law enforcement) their cultivation and distribution.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Legality of peyote in Mexico</p>    
    <p class="px-6">Peyote is also a Schedule I substance in Mexico, where harvesting the plant from the wild is controlled due to peyote’s 
        endangered status. Again, however, religious use is permitted.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>      
    <p class="px-6">As the world grows more interconnected, peyote is often used in locations and contexts that are very different from the indigenous 
        cultures in which it originated. At the same time, peyote is an endangered species. With that in mind, partaking in a peyote ceremony or—especially—using 
        it outside of a ceremonial context requires some ethical considerations to ensure cultural appropriation and destruction are kept in check.</p>
     
    <blockquote>Peyote only grows naturally in Northern Mexico and small areas in South and West Texas. It’s also a slow-growing cactus, taking more than 
        10 years to mature from seed. Add to the mix the rampant and ongoing issues of unsustainable harvesting practices, the black market, and the prohibition 
        of peyote cultivation, and what you get is a rapidly declining population lacking the ability to replenish.</blockquote>
        
    <p class="px-6">This shortage of peyote endangers native traditions that have been in practice for generations. In fact, recent efforts to decriminalize 
        plant medicines at the local level have been denounced by the Native American Church, which argues that loosening these laws sends the message to 
        non-native people that peyote is legal, further threatening its habitat and the sacrament surrounding it.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">Regardless of decriminalization, the renewed interest in plant medicines more generally has created a demand—and market—for 
        peyote ceremonies that take place outside of the context and long history of indigenous traditions. This, of course, further erodes and endangers 
        the cultures that peyote is native to. Some people see “exotic” spiritual practices such as peyote ceremonies as a replacement for the declining 
        organized religions of the west. But these often provide only the appearance of authenticity compared to their familiar religious and spiritual 
        practices. This has led to the perpetuation of the “noble savage” stereotype, which sees indigenous cultures denigrated by Westerners while select 
        cultural practices are lauded—and eventually watered down so much that they’re washed away.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">HISTORY AND STATS</p> 
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Brief History</p>     
    <p class="px-6">The traditional use of peyote is thought to have originated among the Tonkawa or Mescalero tribes of Texas and New Mexico, but it also has 
        strong cultural ties with the Chichimeca and Tarahumara (Rarámuri), as well as the Cora (Náayarite), Huichol (Wixáritari), and other groups who adopted 
        its use later. Given the size of peyote’s native habitat, which extends from the north of the Rio Grande in Texas to the Chihuahuan Desert and 
        Tamaulipan mezquital in Mexico, its use may well have originated independently among a variety of Native American tribes.</p>

    <p class="px-6">Traditional uses are diverse and are not limited to ritual. The Tarahumara, for example, have used it for long-distance endurance 
        foot races and as a topical treatment for wounds, burns, and painful joints.Among the Huichol, it has also been used by pregnant and 
        breastfeeding mothers.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">The first non-natives to encounter peyote use in the Americas were probably Catholic missionaries and conquistadors during the 16th century. 
        Spanish friar Bernardino de Sahagún, for instance, described a Huichol peyote ceremony held in the desert and estimated that such practices may 
        have been at least 1,980 years old. In referring to the cactus, he used the original Nahuatl name, peiotl, meaning “cocoon silk” in reference to 
        the woolly tuft that sprouts from the depressions of the “button.” Unfortunately, the massive destruction of Aztec records by earlier conquistadors 
        means that little is known for certain. More recently, with evidence from the Shumla Caves site in Texas, researchers have been able to date 
        ceremonial peyote use to at least 5,700 years ago.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">During the conquest of the New World, peyote was near-universally condemned by Europeans who associated its use with devil-worship, 
        cannibalism, and witchcraft, and attempted to stamp it out. One persistent peyote user, an Acaxee from Mexico, is said to have had his eyes 
        gouged out as punishment and his stomach sliced open in the shape of a crucifix, leaving dogs to eat his insides. Suppression of the use of 
        peyote continued throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries too—particularly after Native Americans had been forcibly displaced to reservations.</p>
        
    <blockquote>At the same time, the ceremonial use of peyote became all the more important to Native Americans as an emblem of their emerging pan-Indian 
        identity and their ongoing struggle against the so-called “manifest destiny” of their oppressors. Of course, it was also a means of coping spiritually 
        with the subordination and loss of their culture. As a result, native groups formerly at war with each other began to cooperate in a spirit of amicability, 
        spreading peyote use beyond the Southwest to the Great Plains, the Midwest, and even into Canada.</blockquote>
        
    <p class="px-6">During this process, the traditional peyote ceremony was overlaid with Christian elements to help safeguard the new religion as a 
        legitimate form of Christian worship. For example, Jesus was invoked alongside animal spirits, and the “peyote road” (right way of living) was conflated 
        with Christian values. Upon the altar, the “roadman” who led the ceremony not only kept a large sacred peyote button (the “Peyote Chief” or “Father Peyote”) 
        but also a Christian Bible. Interestingly, Peyotism, as it was called, was devoid of all the usual Christian guilt. In fact, it positioned Native 
        Americans as much closer to God than whites, since it was “the whites,” they said, who crucified Jesus—not the ancestrally separated Indians.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">By 1885, despite sustained opposition from missionaries and government officials, the precursor to the Native American Church (NAC) of 
        today was more or less fully established. It was formally registered with a charter in 1918 and, by the 1940s, had opened branch chapters throughout 
        the United States, Canada, and Mexico.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">In 1960, a landmark court case, presided over by Arizona Judge Yale McFate, finally legitimized peyote as having “a similar relation 
        to the Indians—most of whom cannot read—as does the Holy Bible to the white man.” He also pointed out that suppression of its use was unconstitutional 
        since it obstructed religious freedom. By this time, the NAC had roughly 225,000 members (up from 13,300 in 1922) and when peyote (not just mescaline) 
        was classified Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, a special exemption was made for religious use among Native Americans. </p>    
    
    <p class="px-6">ut it wasn’t until the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 that it was truly enshrined as a right. Amendments in 1994 clarified and extended 
        this right to all 50 states.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">Of course, none of this progress took place in isolation. As early as the late-1800s/early-1900s, non-native intellectuals and 
        scientists—including the neurologist Silas Weir Mitchell, the philosopher William James, and the occultist Aleister Crowley—were experimenting with
        peyote for themselves. In fact, the drug company Parke-Davis was even promoting their own liquid peyote extract as an effective “cardiac tonic” 
        (with no mention whatsoever of its psychoactive effects). Other in-depth studies, conducted by German and Austrian scientists, led to the isolation of 
        mescaline in 1897 and its synthesis—the first of any psychedelic—in 1919.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">Later, in 1947, having learned of Nazi experiments exploring mescaline as a possible “truth serum,” the US government began its own 
        secretive program along the same lines, codenamed “Project CHATTER.” This project later gave up on mescaline and turned its attention to LSD, but 
        was ultimately deemed a failure in 1953.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">In the same year, Aldous Huxley first tried mescaline under the supervision of psychiatrist Humphry Osmond, an experience he described 
        in The Doors of Perception as more valid than consensus reality—showing him “for a few timeless hours the outer and the inner world, not as they 
        appear to an animal obsessed with survival or to a human being obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and 
        unconditionally, by Mind at Large … an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.” Two years later, 
        as part of a documentary for the BBC, Osmond also gave mescaline to a British Member of Parliament, his friend Christopher Mayhew. And while Mayhew 
        described his own experience in terms similar to Huxley’s, as a state of complete bliss outside of time and space, a committee of “experts” evidently 
        disagreed with its validity and the footage never aired.</p>
    
    <p class="px-6">Nevertheless, peyote was becoming well known. Throughout the 1960s, a number of anthropologists accompanied the Huichol on peyote 
        hunts (spiritual journeys to gather the cacti) and in 1968 Carlos Castaneda published The Teachings of Don Juan with his own firsthand accounts 
        of peyote visions.</p>

    <p class="px-6">According to the Global Drug Survey in 2014, mescaline or peyote were only among the top 20 drugs for past month usage in Mexico. 
        Peyote was taken by 6.4% and mescaline by 4.4% of 643 Mexican survey respondents.</p>

    <p class="px-6">Of course, we cannot generalize current usage statistics from such limited data, but it does give us some idea of its 
        popularity relative to other substances. Unfortunately, precise usage statistics for peyote aren’t really available because surveys 
        tend to lump it together with other substances like LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA. Hence, SAMHSA’s 2014 finding that 0.4% of the US population 
        used “hallucinogens” in the past month is more or less meaningless.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">That said, we can trace the popularity of peyote over time by looking at its appearance in publications and Google searches. 
        The number of publications related to peyote and mescaline peaked in the 1940s and 50s, followed by a much larger spike in the 1960s and 
        70s—during the psychedelic revolution and roughly coinciding with the publication of Carlos Castaneda’s books. Interest spiked again in the 
        1990s, presumably due to the Mexican government’s 1991 listing of peyote as an endangered species and the 1994 amendments to the American 
        Indian Religious Freedom Act. Published mentions steadily decreased over the next decade or so, possibly because of the rising 
        popularity of other psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">Google searches, meanwhile, have remained fairly steady for peyote since 2004—although searches for mescaline have decreased. 
        Searches for peyote did reach an all-time high in December 2014 (and again in May 2015) but this was most likely in relation to its appearance 
        in the video game Grand Theft Auto V. Unsurprisingly, most Google searches for peyote come from Mexico, the United States, and Canada. 
        (The popularity of the search term in Uruguay likely has more to do with the Uruguayan band El Peyote Asesino.)</p>

    <br>
    
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Where does Peyote grow?</p>
    
    <p class="px-6">The peyote cactus grows primarily in Mexico—in the Chihuahuan Desert and the scrublands of Coahuila, Nuevo León, 
        Tamaulipas, and San Luis Potosí. It also grows in the American Southwest. You can often find peyote in Texas and New Mexico, for instance.</p>

    <p class="px-6">The map below shows a rough outline of traditional peyote locations. For ceremonial practitioners, this has long been the 
        grounds where peyote is collected in the wild.</p>
