    <p class="px-6">Ayahuasca is a powerful plant medicine long considered sacred by the indigenous peoples of the Amazon. It is a hallucinogenic tea 
      that is made typically from the banisteriopsis caapi vine (commonly called ayahuasca) and the leaves of the psychotria viridis shrub (commonly 
      known as chacruna), although it might also be made with the leaves of the diplopterys cabrerana shrub (known as chaliponga or chagroponga).</p>
    
    <p class="px-6">The indigenous people traditionally follow certain dietary guidelines when working with this plant medicine, avoiding specific 
        foods and behaviors in order to have a deeper physical and psychospiritual healing experience with the plant teacher. Following a traditional 
        dieta in the Amazon was straightforward in the old days, since the variety of food available was also limited..</p>

    <p class="px-6">As modern civilization has evolved to expand the range of foods, drugs and other substances we can put into our bodies, the 
      list of things to avoid when preparing for an ayahuasca ceremony has grown longer. In particular, a long and growing list of synthetic drugs 
      are found to be extremely dangerous to use – even fatal – in conjunction with ayahuasca.</p>

    <blockquote>However, the common denominator of the traditional ayahuasca dieta is flavorless food (no salt, sugar or spices, especially hot 
        peppers, onions, and garlic), no sexual stimulation, no alcohol. And no pork.</blockquote>
    
    <p class="px-6">Unfortunately, because many of these synthetic drugs are inventions of the Western world, many indigenous shamans and 
      curanderos will have little understanding of what they are, how to ask if a Western visitor is taking them, nor what to do if there is a fatal reaction.</p>

      <img class="mainimg" src="images/donjcampos.jpg" alt="don Jose Campos painting by Alfredo Zagaceta" justify="center"></p>
      <figcaption>Don Jose Campos. Painting by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alfredozagaceta/">Alfredo Zagaceta</a></figcaption></figure>

    <p class="px-6">For this reason, it’s more important than ever that you, the ayahuasca seeker, do your own due diligence and take responsibility 
        for your own safety. There are 3 main areas of concern that you need to be aware of in order to have a safe and profoundly healing ayahuasca ceremony. 
        <ul class="px-6">These are:
            <li class="px-6">1. Dietary guidelines and food restrictions</li>
            <li class="px-6">2. Spiritual preparation</li>
            <li class="px-6">3. Medical contraindications and dangerous drug combinations</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="px-6">First, I’ll discuss these 3 categories, including some frequently asked questions that come up, and then present you with a 
        long and short list of dietary restrictions to follow.</p>
    
    <br>

  <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">What Is an Ayahuasca Dieta?</p>
  <p class="px-6">Within the Amazonian plant medicine tradition (which has its own deep-rooted philosophies and practices, much like 
      Traditional Chinese Medicine) it’s considered beneficial to prepare oneself physically, emotionally, and spiritually in order to 
      receive the most benefit from working with sacred plant medicines, who are considered to be master teachers, older and wiser than humanity. 
      This method of preparation is known as a dieta. Doing a dieta is like going on a spiritual retreat, where you will be receiving sacred teachings 
      and blessings from a spiritual master, in this case, the master plant teacher.</p>

    <p class="px-6"> It not only involves avoiding certain foods, it’s a process of cleansing your body and mind that involves commitment 
        and sacrifice. It’s believed that by eliminating stimulating food containing salt, sugar, spices, and caffeine, avoiding media and 
        sexual activity, the energy of the plant can work more effectively. It’s also believed that when working with a sacred plant medicine, 
        it’s best to not take any other substances or medicines. Vegetalistas believe that taking other substances causes cutipado or, in other words, 
        interference with the plant’s energy, which can provoke unwanted reactions. The advent of pharmaceutical drugs has also increased the possibility 
        of dangerous drug interactions with ayahuasca.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">What Is an Ayahuasca Dieta?</p>

    <p class="px-6"> If you are a reasonably healthy, mentally-balanced individual who is not currently using pharmaceutical drugs that can 
        have dangerous drug interactions with ayahuasca (which we’ll get to), ignoring the dieta will not result in in bodily harm or death. 
        In fact, you may not notice anything.</p>

    <p class="px-6">If you develop a continued relationship with ayahuasca, you will start to notice that the lifestyle you lead and the 
        food you eat, can have discernible impact on your ceremonial experience. Notably, your ability to access different levels of consciousness 
        and spiritual energies can be affected by the level of toxicity in your body and mind. Some of the most sublime energetic vibrations are also 
        the most subtle; these are more easily experienced when you are physically and emotionally clean.</p>

    <p class="px-6"> If you want go deep with this teacher plant and fully experience her profound mysteries, you want to get serious about cleansing.</p>
    
    <p class="px-6">The point of going into a deep cleanse prior to ayahuasca ceremony is to clear out any toxins from your body and mind, so that you can be open 
    and receptive to the healing and wisdom that teacher plant has to share with you. If you don’t clear them out prior, you will spend your ayahuasca 
    ceremony clearing them out, and visions and insights you could be having will most likely be obscured by many hours of mental, physical and emotional 
    purging, nausea, and overall discomfort. By following dietary guidelines, you will optimize your ayahuasca experience and allow yourself to go deeper 
    into the spirit world, and receive profound psychospiritual healing.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">Ayahuasca Ceremony Dietary Guidelines & Food Restrictions</p>

    <p class="px-6">Ayahuasca ceremony dietary guidelines can vary from place to place, depending on what tradition you are sitting with. 
        In the Amazon, virtually every known Ayahuasca-using culture—including indigenous cultures, mestizo shamans, syncretic churches, and modern 
        drug therapy centers that use Ayahuasca to treat addiction—incorporate some form of the dieta.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">In Western run ayahuasca retreat centers, the list of foods and things to avoid can seem long and daunting, with many items 
        seemingly more based on folklore than science. In Brazil, while sex and alcohol are a no-no, it seems like nobody really follows any food 
        regimen, because the prevailing attitude seems to be – you can puke over there.</p>

    <p class="px-6">However, the common denominator of the traditional ayahuasca dieta is flavorless food (no salt, sugar or spices, 
        especially hot peppers, onions, and garlic), no sexual stimulation, no alcohol. And no pork.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">Why Avoiding Foods Containing Tyramines Will Improve Your Ayahuasca Journey</p>

    <p class="px-6">Ayahuasca (<em>banisteriopsis caapi</em>) is an MAO-inhibitor, which means it temporarily inhibits the activation of the 
        monoamine oxidase (MAO). This enzyme is essential to process the amino acid tyramine, so it’s important to refrain from eating 
        foods high in this amino acid, otherwise your body won’t be able to process it.</p>

    <p class="px-6">This can lead to headaches, hypertension, or just hours and hours of subthreshold nausea where you feel like vomiting, 
        but can’t. And that feeling dominates your entire ayahuasca ritual, so that instead of having beautiful, celestial visions, and 
        divine downloads, you are crouched over a bucket trying to purge.</p>
    
    <ul class="px-6">Foods that contain tyramine include:</p>

        <li class="px-6">• Pork</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Red meat</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Aged cheeses</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Fermented foods like soy sauce, fermented tofu, and sauerkraut</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Yogurt</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Alcohol</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Nutritional supplements like protein powders</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Aspartame</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Chocolate (in large amounts)</li>
        <li class="px-6">• Peanuts (in large amounts)</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Why Avoid Salty, Sugary, & Spicy Foods?</p>
    <p class="px-6"> From a shamanic healing perspective, intensely-flavored food creates the cutipado effect that obstructs the energy of 
        the plant medicine. Spicy foods are less likely to offend the gods and more likely to offend your throat, sinuses and butthole as 
        they come out. Salt and sugar tend to also come back out in a noticeably concentrated way, so that the honey sweetened tea you 
        drank earlier, and ice cream you ate hours before that (which you are now so clear it has been pumped full of artificial 
        flavors), appear to be regurgitating as a sickly-sweet, condensed syrupy vomit.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Why Avoid Animal Products?</p>
    <p class="px-6">These days, animal products are chock full of chemicals – from antibiotics, to hormones – and are raised and slaughtered 
        in inhumane ways. Unless you are consuming organic, free range poultry, or wild game from the jungle, it’s best to avoid any 
        industrialized animal products. One of the things I’ve noticed time and time again during ayahuasca ceremony, is that we 
        consume not only the substance of our food, but the energy of it. So if you consume an animal that was pumped full of chemicals, 
        spent the entirety of its life miserably crammed in a pen, only to finally be slaughtered, en masse, in a mechanized way, you also 
        ingest the energy of that animal’s experience.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Why Consider Avoiding Rice, Lentils, Couscous & Other Granulated Foods?</p>
    <p class="px-6">You can eat these things, but it’s not fun to have rice grains stuck in your sinuses from a bout of projectile vomiting.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Will Juice Fasting Before Ceremony Help?</p>
    <p class="px-6">While juice fasting might seem like an obvious way to cleanse before your ayahuasca ritual, it may set you up for a 
        suboptimal experience. Firstly, juice, even veggie juice, can contain a lot of sugar, which is something to avoid pre-ceremony. 
        Also, an ayahuasca journey can be an physically, emotionally, and spiritually taxing experience. I personally find that having 
        solid food several hours before the ceremony begins allows me to have the energy to sustain the ride. Finally, if you have no food 
        in your system, you might find yourself really hungry in the middle of the ceremony, which can be distracting.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">When Should I Have My Last Meal?</p>
    <p class="px-6">In general, you want to avoid eating less than 4 hours before the ceremony begins. In the very least, 2 hours, 
        but you will be amazed at how much food is still undigested after 2 hours.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">How to Spiritually Prepare for An Ayahuasca Ceremony</p>
    <p class="px-6">In the Amazon, the dieta is not only about food, it also includes guidelines for mental, emotional, and spiritual 
        preparation in the days leading up to your work with the Madre Ayahuasca. Old school ayahuasqueros would go into the forest on 
        extended solitary retreat in order to seek and diet with the plants, surviving on their own hunting and foraging skills. In villages, 
        it would include keeping yourself in relative solitude and minimizing idle chatter. In industrialized countries, a modern dieta would 
        definitely include a fast from television, radio, movies, news and social media.</p>

    <p class="px-6">What you want to do is spend as many days preceding your ceremony engaged in activities like yoga, meditation, 
        mindfulness practice, prayer and solitary walks in the woods. Begin spiritually communing with Nature before your date-night with 
        her, when Madre flings open the doors to direct communication with Pachamama.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Avoid Negative Vibes Before Ayahuasca</p>
    <p class="px-6">Ayahuasca is a shamanic medicine. Beyond the fact that it is a powerful brew of psychoactive chemicals, it is traditionally 
        used in a ceremonial container where the shaman is calling upon spirits – ancestors, animal spirits, elemental spirits – to come into 
        the space and heal people. The person drinking ayahuasca, from a spiritual perspective, is opening up their psychic capacity to see 
        and communicate with non-embodied beings.</p>

    <p class="px-6">In the world of Amazonian shamanism, non-embodied beings are around us at all times. In fact, in the Amazon, it’s 
        believed that each person walks around with an entourage of spirits who are connected to them in some way. Some are demonic or 
        parasitic, and most likely associated with an addiction. Some are karmic. Others are ancestors, guides and protectors.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">You can also pick up entities while going about your daily business. When your energetic field is open, as in the 
        case in an ayahuasca ceremony, those entities can “get in” and wreck havoc in your life, whether it’s through misfortune or 
        illness. So as a general rule of thumb, to prevent this kind of thing from happening, it’s good to only be in high-vibe scenarios,
         and avoid taking the shortcut through the bad part of town, hanging out in bars, or places of ill repute and seedy people. If you 
         cannot avoid these locales, bolster your protective energy field through increased spiritual practice.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Why You Want to Avoid Sex (Including Sex With Yourself) Prior to Ayahuasca Ceremony</p>
    <p class="px-6">Sex and alcohol abstinence are the 2 most common denominators in ayahuasca dieta recommended by all traditions. 
        Sex involves a powerful energetic exchange and if you are sexually engaged with someone in the days leading up to ceremony, 
        there is a strong likelihood that you will feel their energy in your own energetic field very strongly during ceremony. This can 
        be confusing. It may cause you to project more than is healthy on the other person and your relationship. It might cause you to become 
        more emotionally attached. That person you had casual sex with is now looking like “The One”.</p>

    <p class="px-6">This includes fantasizing sexually about other people.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">Furthermore, sexual activity can deplete your reservoir of energy that’s available to you during the ritual, 
        which can limit the depth at which you can psychonautically journey and inhibit the plant’s ability to give you guidance. 
        This is why it’s also recommended to avoid masturbating.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">In any case, an ayahuasca ceremony is about your spiritual work and your healing. So it’s very important to 
        keep your energy as clear, contained, and free of other people as possible.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Don't Drink Alcohol Before Ceremony</p>
    <p class="px-6">One of the old school ayahuasqueros I’ve had the good fortune of spending time was known to drink moonshine 
        in between cups of ayahuasca during a ritual. The ayahuasca that this tribe traditionally brews, however, tends to be very 
        light, which is probably what makes this combination remotely feasible.</p>

    <p class="px-6">Sadly, as with Native Americans in North America, alcoholism is a tragic legacy of colonialism that continues 
        into the modern era. I consider this elder to be one of the last, authentic ayahuasqueros on earth, the last of 8 generations 
        of ayahuasqueros in his family, who has spent years in solitary dieta in the forest, and a master practitioner of the limpieza. 
        At the same time, he really does like his trago.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">So alcohol and ayahuasca most likely won’t kill you, but drinking it before ceremony will most likely make you feel 
        like shit. In the very least, when it comes up, you will also be acutely aware of how shitty alcohol is, not just in your purge, but in your body, in general.    
        What I have noticed is that the sooner I have alcohol after my ayahuasca ceremony, the shorter the ayahuasca afterglow ends up being.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Can You Smoke or Consume Weed?</p>
    <p class="px-6">Again, traditional dieta recommends that you clear out all other substances and medications before meeting Madre. 
        However, there are churches, groups, and shamans who consume a lot of marijuana and drink a lot of ayahuasca, sometimes 
        simultaneously. There is a lot of controversy around this practice.</p>

    <p class="px-6">My recommendation is, experience different scenarios. Experience ayahuasca ceremony in a container of weed 
        abstinence. This will help you get to know the energy of this plant spirit.</p>
    
    <p class="px-6">Experience a Santa Maria Daime work where marijuana is consecrated during the concentração, and big fatties are 
        being passed down the pews, with each member doing the sign of the cross before taking a big puff, until the entire church is hotboxed.</p>

    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">Medical Contraindications & Dangerous Drug Interactions</p>
    <p class="px-6">This is where we leave the world of traditional dieta and address the ayahuasca safety considerations created by the 
        globalization. Indigenous shamans did not account for pharmaceutical medications in the ayahuasca dieta, because they didn’t exist 
        in the Amazon back then, and usage is still primarily a Western phenomenon.</p>

    <p class="px-6">Mixing ayahuasca with certain pharmaceutical drugs or plant-based admixtures can be dangerous and lethal. 
        Not only are some of these combinations life-threatening, the particular manner in which you could die, such as serotonin 
        syndrome – could be extremely unpleasant.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">However, it’s important to note that ayahuasca-related deaths are extremely rare.</p>
        

    <ul class="px-6">

        <li class="px-6">1. <strong>SSRI Medications.</strong> Any medication that has an effect on the serotonin system, including Selective Serotonin 
            Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), can induce serotonin syndrome, with potentially fatal results when combined with ayahuasca.</li><br>
        <li class="px-6">2. <strong>MAOIs.</strong> Any medication that contains MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are known to cause dangerous side effects when taken in 
            conjunction with ayahuasca and should be suspended. Contraindications to the use of MAOIs include severe liver and kidney 
            impairment, severe or frequent headache, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases.</li><br>
        <li class="px-6">3. <strong>Brugmansia a.k.a. Toé.</strong> Toé flowering shrub from the nightshade family that’s closely related to datura. Also known 
            as angel’s trumpet, it is recognized by its large, golden trumpet-shaped flowers. Some ayahuasca shamans will put toé in their 
            ayahuasca brew. Excessive use of toé can cause permanent mental impairment. Deaths can occur from miscalculated dosages.</li><br>
        <li class="px-6">4. <strong>5-MeO-DMT & Bufo alvarius.</strong>  The practice of smoking the secretions of the Sonoron Desert Toad, or Bufo alvarius, 
            has entered shamanic circles. The secretions contain more than a dozen tryptamine compounds, the most important of which are 
            bufotenin and 5-MeO-DMT, which may have contraindications with the harmala alkaloids in ayahuasca. At least two deaths that 
            have been recorded in the medical literature where harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT have been found in autopsies. To avoid interactions 
            individuals should wait at least 24 hours, after ingesting ayahuasca before inhaling <em>Bufo alvarius </em>.</li>

    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold"> Ayahuasca Preparation Checklist</p>

    <p class="px-6">Ideally, you want to prepare yourself as best you can for your encounter with the Madre. Like a yogi in preparation to go 
        into a meditation retreat, you want to begin purifying your body by eliminating certain foods and drugs from your system at least 
        2-4 weeks prior to ceremony. For certain prescription drugs, including SSRIs, the abstinence period will be even longer.</p>

    <p class="px-6">A good rule of thumb is to eat organic, whole foods and go blandly cooked vegan.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">At least 6 weeks out:</p>
    <p class="px-6">Any medication that has an effect on the serotonin system, including Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

        <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Ayahuasca Ceremony Preparation – the Short List</p>
        <p class="px-6">If you decided to join an ayahuasca ceremony on short notice or have had a hard time extricating yourself from the patterns of your busy, overstimulated modern life, here’s the bare minimum you ought to try to do, for as many days as possible before and after:
            <ul class="px-6">
            <li class="px-6">• No sexual activity for as many days as possible</li>
            <li class="px-6">• No alcohol for as many days as possible</li>
            <li class="px-6">• No violent, negative media consumption for as many days as possible</li>
            <li class="px-6">• No pharmaceutical drugs or street drugs for as many days as possible. <br><em><strong>** NOTE: Contraindicative medications need weeks.</em></strong></li>
            <li class="px-6">• No sugar, salt, hot spices day of</li>
            <li class="px-6">• No processed foods day of</li>
            <li class="px-6">** Stop eating 4 hours before you expect to actually drink the ayahuasca.</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="px-6">All in all, if you are a healthy, mentally-balanced person who isn’t taking a bunch of drugs, nothing bad will 
            happen to you if you don’t follow dieta. The gods won’t strike you down, and you won’t suddenly keel over in a psychedelic 
            fanfare and die. You might have more noticeably more awful shits or traumatic projectile vomits, and spend most of the ritual 
            in the uncomfortable in-between state of wanting to puke and puking.</p>

        <p class="px-6">Rather, not following dieta just limits the benefits you can receive, such as luminous, technicolor visions, 
            clear cosmic downloads, and undulating waves of full-body bliss for hours and hours. So if you really want that, by following 
            dieta, you help eliminate all the crap that can get in the way…no pun intended.</p>



  <br>
  <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Always expect the best</p>
  <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Have a beautiful ceremony!</p>
