    <p class="px-6">Ayahuasca is a powerful plant medicine long considered sacred by the indigenous peoples of the Amazon. It is a hallucinogenic tea 
      that is made typically from the banisteriopsis caapi vine (commonly called ayahuasca) and the leaves of the psychotria viridis shrub (commonly 
      known as chacruna), although it might also be made with the leaves of the diplopterys cabrerana shrub (known as chaliponga or chagroponga).</p>
    
    <p class="px-6">The indigenous people traditionally follow certain dietary guidelines when working with this plant medicine, avoiding specific 
        foods and behaviors in order to have a deeper physical and psychospiritual healing experience with the plant teacher. Following a traditional 
        dieta in the Amazon was straightforward in the old days, since the variety of food available was also limited..</p>

    <p class="px-6">As modern civilization has evolved to expand the range of foods, drugs and other substances we can put into our bodies, the 
      list of things to avoid when preparing for an ayahuasca ceremony has grown longer. In particular, a long and growing list of synthetic drugs 
      are found to be extremely dangerous to use – even fatal – in conjunction with ayahuasca.</p>

    <blockquote>However, the common denominator of the traditional ayahuasca dieta is flavorless food (no salt, sugar or spices, especially hot 
        peppers, onions, and garlic), no sexual stimulation, no alcohol. And no pork.</blockquote>
    
    <p class="px-6">Unfortunately, because many of these synthetic drugs are inventions of the Western world, many indigenous shamans and 
      curanderos will have little understanding of what they are, how to ask if a Western visitor is taking them, nor what to do if there is a fatal reaction.</p>

    <p class="px-6">For this reason, it’s more important than ever that you, the ayahuasca seeker, do your own due diligence and take responsibility 
        for your own safety. There are 3 main areas of concern that you need to be aware of in order to have a safe and profoundly healing ayahuasca ceremony. 
        <ul class="px-6">These are:
            <li class="px-6">Dietary guidelines and food restrictions</li>
            <li class="px-6">Spiritual preparation</li>
            <li class="px-6">Medical contraindications and dangerous drug combinations</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="px-6">First, I’ll discuss these 3 categories, including some frequently asked questions that come up, and then present you with a 
        long and short list of dietary restrictions to follow.</p>
    
    <br>

  <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">What Is an Ayahuasca Dieta?</p>
  <p class="px-6">Within the Amazonian plant medicine tradition (which has its own deep-rooted philosophies and practices, much like 
      Traditional Chinese Medicine) it’s considered beneficial to prepare oneself physically, emotionally, and spiritually in order to 
      receive the most benefit from working with sacred plant medicines, who are considered to be master teachers, older and wiser than humanity. 
      This method of preparation is known as a dieta. Doing a dieta is like going on a spiritual retreat, where you will be receiving sacred teachings 
      and blessings from a spiritual master, in this case, the master plant teacher.</p>

    <p class="px-6"> It not only involves avoiding certain foods, it’s a process of cleansing your body and mind that involves commitment 
        and sacrifice. It’s believed that by eliminating stimulating food containing salt, sugar, spices, and caffeine, avoiding media and 
        sexual activity, the energy of the plant can work more effectively. It’s also believed that when working with a sacred plant medicine, 
        it’s best to not take any other substances or medicines. Vegetalistas believe that taking other substances causes cutipado or, in other words, 
        interference with the plant’s energy, which can provoke unwanted reactions. The advent of pharmaceutical drugs has also increased the possibility 
        of dangerous drug interactions with ayahuasca.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">What Is an Ayahuasca Dieta?</p>

    <p class="px-6"> If you are a reasonably healthy, mentally-balanced individual who is not currently using pharmaceutical drugs that can 
        have dangerous drug interactions with ayahuasca (which we’ll get to), ignoring the dieta will not result in in bodily harm or death. 
        In fact, you may not notice anything.</p>

    <p class="px-6">If you develop a continued relationship with ayahuasca, you will start to notice that the lifestyle you lead and the 
        food you eat, can have discernible impact on your ceremonial experience. Notably, your ability to access different levels of consciousness 
        and spiritual energies can be affected by the level of toxicity in your body and mind. Some of the most sublime energetic vibrations are also 
        the most subtle; these are more easily experienced when you are physically and emotionally clean.</p>

    <p class="px-6"> If you want go deep with this teacher plant and fully experience her profound mysteries, you want to get serious about cleansing.</p>
    
    <p class="px-6">The point of going into a deep cleanse prior to ayahuasca ceremony is to clear out any toxins from your body and mind, so that you can be open 
    and receptive to the healing and wisdom that teacher plant has to share with you. If you don’t clear them out prior, you will spend your ayahuasca 
    ceremony clearing them out, and visions and insights you could be having will most likely be obscured by many hours of mental, physical and emotional 
    purging, nausea, and overall discomfort. By following dietary guidelines, you will optimize your ayahuasca experience and allow yourself to go deeper 
    into the spirit world, and receive profound psychospiritual healing.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">Ayahuasca Ceremony Dietary Guidelines & Food Restrictions</p>

    <p class="px-6">Ayahuasca ceremony dietary guidelines can vary from place to place, depending on what tradition you are sitting with. 
        In the Amazon, virtually every known Ayahuasca-using culture — including indigenous cultures, mestizo shamans, syncretic churches, and modern 
        drug therapy centers that use Ayahuasca to treat addiction — incorporate some form of the dieta.</p>
        
    <p class="px-6">In Western run ayahuasca retreat centers, the list of foods and things to avoid can seem long and daunting, with many items 
        seemingly more based on folklore than science. In Brazil, while sex and alcohol are a no-no, it seems like nobody really follows any food 
        regimen, because the prevailing attitude seems to be – you can puke over there.</p>

    <p class="px-6">However, the common denominator of the traditional ayahuasca dieta is flavorless food (no salt, sugar or spices, 
        especially hot peppers, onions, and garlic), no sexual stimulation, no alcohol. And no pork.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="px-6 subtitle has-text-weight-bold">Why Avoiding Foods Containing Tyramines Will Improve Your Ayahuasca Trip</p>

    <p class="px-6">Ayahuasca (banisteriopsis caapi) is an MAO-inhibitor, which means it temporarily inhibits the activation of the 
        monoamine oxidase (MAO). This enzyme is essential to process the amino acid tyramine, so it’s important to refrain from eating 
        foods high in this amino acid, otherwise your body won’t be able to process it.</p>

    <p class="px-6">This can lead to headaches, hypertension, or just hours and hours of subthreshold nausea where you feel like vomiting, 
        but can’t. And that feeling dominates your entire ayahuasca ritual, so that instead of having beautiful, celestial visions, and 
        divine downloads, you are crouched over a bucket trying to purge.</p>
    
    <ul class="px-6">Foods that contain tyramine include:</p>

        <li class="px-6">Pork</li>
        <li class="px-6">Red meat</li>
        <li class="px-6">Aged cheeses</li>
        <li class="px-6">Fermented foods like soy sauce, fermented tofu, and sauerkraut</li>
        <li class="px-6">Yogurt</li>
        <li class="px-6">Alcohol</li>
        <li class="px-6">Nutritional supplements like protein powders</li>
        <li class="px-6">Aspartame</li>
        <li class="px-6">Chocolate (in large amounts)</li>
        <li class="px-6">Peanuts (in large amounts)</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Why Avoid Salty, Sugary, & Spicy Foods?</p>
    <p class="px-6"> From a shamanic healing perspective, intensely-flavored food creates the cutipado effect that obstructs the energy of 
        the plant medicine. Spicy foods are less likely to offend the gods and more likely to offend your throat, sinuses and butthole as 
        they come out. Salt and sugar tend to also come back out in a noticeably concentrated way, so that the honey sweetened tea you 
        drank earlier, and ice cream you ate hours before that (which you are now so clear it has been pumped full of artificial 
        flavors), appear to be regurgitating as a sickly-sweet, condensed syrupy vomit.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Why Avoid Animal Products?</p>
    <p class="px-6">These days, animal products are chock full of chemicals – from antibiotics, to hormones – and are raised and slaughtered 
        in inhumane ways. Unless you are consuming organic, free range poultry, or wild game from the jungle, it’s best to avoid any 
        industrialized animal products. One of the things I’ve noticed time and time again during ayahuasca ceremony, is that we 
        consume not only the substance of our food, but the energy of it. So if you consume an animal that was pumped full of chemicals, 
        spent the entirety of its life miserably crammed in a pen, only to finally be slaughtered, en masse, in a mechanized way, you also 
        ingest the energy of that animal’s experience.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Why Consider Avoiding Rice, Lentils, Couscous & Other Granulated Foods?</p>
    <p class="px-6">You can eat these things, but it’s not fun to have rice grains stuck in your sinuses from a bout of projectile vomiting.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">Will Juice Fasting Before Ceremony Help?</p>
    <p class="px-6">While juice fasting might seem like an obvious way to cleanse before your ayahuasca ritual, it may set you up for a 
        suboptimal experience. Firstly, juice, even veggie juice, can contain a lot of sugar, which is something to avoid pre-ceremony. 
        Also, an ayahuasca journey can be an physically, emotionally, and spiritually taxing experience. I personally find that having 
        solid food several hours before the ceremony begins allows me to have the energy to sustain the ride. Finally, if you have no food 
        in your system, you might find yourself really hungry in the middle of the ceremony, which can be distracting.</p>

    <p class="px-6 has-text-weight-bold">When Should I Have My Last Meal?</p>
    <p class="px-6">In general, you want to avoid eating less than 4 hours before the ceremony begins. In the very least, 2 hours, 
        but you will be amazed at how much food is still undigested after 2 hours.</p>
