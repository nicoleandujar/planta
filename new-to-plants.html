        <p class="title px-6">Healing the Emotional, Energetic, and Spiritual Bodies: Addressing the Root Cause</p>

        <p class="px-6">Far from being part of the “New Age” movement, plant medicine healthcare has existed for thousands o
          f years and was a well-established system long before Western medicine developed in the last few hundred years. 
          Just as modern medicine has excelled at getting to the physical causes of illness, plant medicine – in particular, 
          ayahuasca – offers a chance to get at the emotional, energetic, and spiritual roots of dis-ease by opening channels 
          f communication to our subconscious inner landscapes.</p>

          <p class="px-6">From a shamanistic point of view, most illnesses and diseases are manifestations of blockages or “knots” in the energy 
          of a person, or where excess or insufficient energy creates imbalance in the overall system. This often happens 
          throughout our life from trauma in its various forms. Shock trauma – often the result of abuse, attack, or loss – 
          is one form, but trauma can result from many common occurrences of life: surgery, accidents, illnesses, injuries, 
          relationships, financial difficulties, cultural and societal pressures, betrayal or anger from close ones, even problems 
          from birth we may be unaware of – just to name a few.</p>
          
          <p class="px-6">With the help of ayahuasca, trained and ethical healers can address and correct these imbalanced energies through healing
          ceremonies.  This is contrary to Western medicine, which focuses on the physical body and outward symptoms of an illness. 
          Such an emphasis can end up blocking our innate healing process by suppressing these symptoms without addressing the root 
          energetic cause, denying or invalidating the experience and associated emotions, or over-emphasizing adjustment or control. 
          As a result, insufficient importance is placed on the energetic body, which encompasses the mental and emotional well-being of a person.</p>
          
          <blockquote>“One of the most frustrating failures of Western medical practice is its lack of awareness of the unity of mind and body 
          despite voluminous, elegant, and absolutely persuasive research evidence that the distinction between mind and body is 
          false, unscientific, and – in real life – impossible.”– Dr. Gabor Maté, from foreword of The Fellowship of the River by Dr. Joe Tafur</blockquote>
          
          <p class="px-6">When we are young, we often inherit the patterns, habits, and ways of life from our parents, relatives, or those who 
          raised us. We are also heavily shaped by the events in our lives that happen to us at a young age. Ayahuasca can take us 
          back to this time and revisit memories which shaped the way we perceived life, created our values, and shaped our beliefs.
          When negative events or emotions happened, our tendency as children was to turn away from that pain, avoid it and push it 
          down into our subconscious. This created energetic imprints that we carried into our adult life, manifesting in a multitude 
          of ways and practices, including how we handle stress, our predisposition to addiction, depression and anxiety, and the way 
          in which we connect with ourselves and others. In this work, we are invited to engage with our inner child, and rescue those 
          parts which still carry pain through reflecting upon, integrating, and then releasing the associated negative emotions and their 
          energetic hold on us. By healing the inner child, we heal all that which follows, and can return to a place of authenticity, presence, and peace.</p>

          <figcaption>Ayahuasca vine in the Peruvian Amazon</figcaption></figure>

          <p class="px-6">The alchemy of transformation comes from engaging directly with our shadow selves, our emotional pain and discomfort. It is 
          not a process that one can simply “think through” – it is one of the heart, and can only be truly dealt with through the direct 
          experience of the emotions and traumas we’ve been avoiding. When we fully integrate our shadow self, transforming the energy from 
          it and using it instead for life-affirming purposes, we can enter into a state of love and gratitude that can only come from walking 
          through the fire and coming out on the other side. By bringing the subconscious blockages to the surface, amplifying the patterns and 
          processes that no longer serve us, and helping us face it, ayahuasca allows us the ability to transform that darkness into the keys to our liberation.</p>
          
          <blockquote>“There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their 
          own Soul. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.”— Carl Jung</blockquote>
          

          <p class="px-6"><strong>Culture, Icaros, & Plant Spirit Shamanism</strong></p>
          <p class="px-6">The Shipibo people are one of 14 indigenous tribes living in the Amazon Basin in Peru. They are a long-standing tribe credited with 
          maintaining a time-honored history of plant-spirit shamanism, particularly surrounding the ritual use of ayahuasca. For them, much of 
          their knowledge and worldview comes from a deeply-rooted relationship to plants, animals, and the natural world. This is evidenced in 
          their pottery, textiles, baskets, art, and beadwork, which display patterns representative of the harmonious energy field that pervades 
          all things. This concept of an all-encompassing reality of oneness can challenge the typical Western mind, but it is what informs and 
          influences the efficacy of their shamanic practices. These patterns represent not only the oneness of creation, the non-dualistic nature 
          of all things, the union or fusion of perceived opposites – they are also an ongoing dialogue or communion with the spiritual world and powers of Nature.</p>
          

          <img class="mainimg" src="images/shipiboart.jpg" alt="shipibo art cloths" justify="center"></p>
          <figcaption>Shipibo Art - Weaving the songs of the medicine</figcaption></figure>


          <p class="px-6">The visionary art of the Shipibo brings this paradigm into a physical form. In the same way, the icaros, or healing songs, sung during 
          ayahuasca ceremonies are the audial representation of these patterns. Thus, during ceremony, the shaman is accessing the geometric patterns 
          of energy from the plants, which transform through the vessel of the Maestro to a chant or icaro. The icaro is therefore a conduit for the 
          patterns of creation, which then permeate the body of the shaman’s patient, bringing harmony in the form of the geometric patterns in order 
          to re-balance the patient’s body. In effect, they are transforming the visual code into an acoustic code, which allows the healing energy 
          to penetrate much deeper into the system of the patient and release negative energy blockages and their emotional counterparts. The shaman 
          knows when the healing is complete, as the design is clearly distinct in the patient’s body. Oftentimes it takes multiple ceremonies to 
          complete this, and when the completed healing designs are embedded in the patient’s body, this is called an arcana. This internal patterning 
          is deemed to be permanent and to protect a person’s spirit going forward.</p>
          
          <p class="px-6">It is only through years of training, apprenticeship, and dietas with master plants, that healers are able to access and recruit a team of 
          plant-spirit healers to work with and heal their patients’ energetic body. Typically, Shipibo curanderos (healers) undergo a number of dietas 
          normally lasting one, three, six, or 12 months, over many years, in order to become a conduit for transferring the healing energies of the plants. 
          While the curandero is not the one carrying out the healing (this is the role of the plant spirits), they are certainly a part of the equation, 
          and as such, must be highly trained, psychologically and emotionally balanced, well-intentioned, and have an open and loving heart. It is vital 
          that the curandero is able to protect the ceremonial space and guide participants safely along their journeys through the use of icaros. 
          As such, master curanderos spend years training apprentices and passing their knowledge and practices down through generations.</p>
          
          <blockquote>The Shipibo traditions, practices, products, and culture as a whole embody the rich and complex cosmological system that is their heritage. </blockquote>

            <p class="px-6">The Shipibo are comprised of approximately 50,000 people centered around the Ucayali River in the northeastern Peruvian Amazon. 
          Previously two distinct tribes, the Shipibo and the Conibo, cultural similarities and intermarriages eventually formed one cohesive group. 
          Like many indigenous tribes around the world, their culture has changed dramatically in recent centuries due to the pressures of colonialism, 
          corporate resource extraction in the rainforest, and the influence of missionaries. Nevertheless, much of their traditions persist today in 
          the form of ayahuasca ceremonies and rituals, and active effort is being made by Soltara and many other groups to protect, maintain, and 
          elevate their culture and wisdom.</p>
